del_feature.ipynb
- Feature Selection using SHAP value for train fitted classification model

numpy_selected_feature_5fold_original_300.npy
- numpy array that contains the information of Selected Feature from `del_feature.ipynb`

sub_with_reg_and_cls_422.ipynb
- Train and Test the classification and regression model

## Dataset
We train and evaluate our model using the dataset from [Classifying Smart Factory Product Quality Status](https://dacon.io/en/competitions/official/236080/data)

we assume that you have downloaded it and placed based on File Structure, inside the dataset folder.

## Submission Process
1. Run All code in `del_feature.ipynb` to select important features and save in the `numpy_selected_feature_5fold_original_300.npy` file.

2. Run All code in `sub_with_reg_and_cls_422` to classify product quality using the regression model and classification model.
